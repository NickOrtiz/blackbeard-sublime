greybeard is a fork of [brogrammer](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme/) a dark, flat, sexy theme. greybeard changes the main theme color from red to blue grey. reveals the scrollbars. features [gohuFont](http://font.gohu.org) throughout the ui. and is designed for the monokai theme, what enticed ~~most~~ all of us to use sublime text in the first place.

## install

1. [download the .zip](https://github.com/xero/theme-greybeard/archive/master.zip)
2. unzip to `theme-greybeard` folder in the `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` in sublime text.
